Order of work for KSP-N3923-2_2018ku

1. Update light curves *.lc.*.txt in \cockpit-lc
2. Make light curves into SNooPy compatible format
   >python LCsnpy.py
3. Recompute template parameters using SNooPy
   >python SNphillips.py
4. Refit early light curve (Tmax and maxes have changed)
   >python EarlyFit.py
5. Refit Arnett model (Tmax has changed)
   >python ArnettFit.py
6. Compare with Kasen models (Arnett parameters changed)
   >python KasenCompare.py
7. Run more extensive Kasen modelling in /kasen-mc

Note:
Edit ObjData.py after each step, fill out the form using new outputs.
(Otherwise, nothing will change).
For part 2: make sure old sn_file is removed
Parts 5, 6 outputs should not change much with new data.
Part 3 may change a lot.
We should update light curves, and then do these steps every few days.

For convenience:
I use LCfig.py to plot my light curves.
I use LCplot.py to check light curve characteristics.
