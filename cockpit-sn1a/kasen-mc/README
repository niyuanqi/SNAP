Order of work for kasen comparison of KSP-N3923-2_2018ku

1. Update values in ObjData with latest results from Arnett fitting etc.
2. Compare the full range of kasen models (a13, conf) naively
   assuming flux measurement is the only error source. This is fast.
   >python KasenF.py
3. Compare again, but this time using Monte Carlo to account for full
   range of errors. This is very time consuming.
   >python KasenMC.py
4. Check results of kasen monte carlo using
   >python plotkasen.py

Key Note:
You should move this kasen-fit directory onto sn1987a,
which has many more cores, and continue to run KasenMC on 32 cores.
Your home computer may crash otherwise.
Note RAM usage, if RAM usage too high, computer may crash.
To use less RAM, reduce size of a13s array in KasenMC.py

Note:
Whenever you suspect monte carlo behaves funny (non-smooth features),
It may be because not enough trials to resolve smooth behaviour.
When that happens, run step 3 twice, and plot both results on same graph.
Check that the results don't change much between simulations.
If it changes by a lot, then change nmc, make it bigger (slower also).
I don't think we ever need to remake the early light curves.
Arnett fitting may change a lot as new data comes in.
